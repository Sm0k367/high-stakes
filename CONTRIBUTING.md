# CONTRIBUTING TO EPIC TECH AI // HIGH_STAKES

Welcome to the neural collective. To maintain the integrity of the **Epic Tech AI** brand and the efficiency of the **TSI_ORG** infrastructure, all contributors must adhere to these protocols.

## NEURAL STANDARDS
1. **Performance First:** All visual additions must be optimized for WebGL. Avoid heavy frameworks.
2. **Brand Aesthetic:** Keep the "Machine-Built" vibe. Use the core palette:
   * **Epic Cyan:** `#00f2ff`
   * **Epic Magenta:** `#ff00ff`
   * **Deep Terminal:** `#020202`
3. **Economy Integration:** Any new features should reward the user with **Smoken Tokens** via the `updateWallet()` function.

## WORKFLOW PROTOCOL
1. **Fork the Node:** Create a branch for your specific feature (e.g., `feature/neural-audio-viz`).
2. **Inject Code:** Ensure your logic is modular and does not break the core `main.js` boot sequence.
3. **Validation:** Test the **Drag-and-Drop** functionality to ensure media injection remains stable.
4. **Pull Request:** Submit your changes with a clear log of how many Smoken Tokens the new feature generates for the user.

## DIGITAL BACKPACK COMPATIBILITY
Ensure all assets or media you contribute are compatible with the global Digital Backpack standard:
* **Images:** PNG/SVG (Transparent preferred)
* **Video:** MP4 (H.264 for web optimization)
* **Audio:** MP3 (High-bitrate for frequency scanning)

## PARTNER SYNERGY
We build in public and in sync with:
* **@tsi_org** (Infrastructure)
* **@myaitutor** (Intelligence)
* **@pixio_ai** (Visual Assets)

*Failure to follow brand guidelines will result in neural disconnect. Build with intent.*
